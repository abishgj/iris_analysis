Analysis of the Iris dataset

Iris dataset is one of the most simplest dataset we can find. We have done a basic analysis of the different attributes contributing to the three different Iris flower classes.

Here is a snap from our analysis:

* Flower class Iris-setosa exhibit these properties: 
 * Shorter sepal length
 * Longest sepal width
 * Shorter petal length
 * Shorter petal width
* Flower class Iris-versicolor exhibit these properties:
 * Longer sepal length
 * Shorter sepal width
 * Moderate petal length
 * Moderate petal width
* Flower class Iris-virginica exhibit these properties:
 * Longest sepal length
 * Moderate sepal width
 * Longest petal length
 * Longest petal width
